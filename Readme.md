## Ionic Google SignIn Using Firebase  

>>To get started with Google sign in, we need to install a Capacitor community plugin:  
```
npm i @codetrix-studio/capacitor-google-auth`  
npx cap update  
```

### Android Preparation  
>>Open the Firebase project settings and click Add app and select Android.  

>>Make sure you put in the correct bundle ID of your app - the one thatâ€™s already in your capacitor.config.json, that you picked during initial app setup and that will later be used inside your Google Play console and Apple developer account for your app.  

>>We also need SHA-1 signing certificate.  

>>After Completing all these steps download the **google-services.json** file and move it to the android/app folder inside your Ionic project.  

>>To make the value available to our Android app we also need to make a change to the **android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml** and add an entry for the server_client_id:
```
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<resources>
    <string name="app_name">Ionic Google</string>
    <string name="title_activity_main">Ionic Google</string>
    <string name="package_name">com.googlesignin.ionic</string>
    <string name="custom_url_scheme">com.googlesignin.ionic</string>
    _<string name="server_client_id">REPLACEME.apps.googleusercontent.com</string>_
</resources>
```
